# Portfolio 2025

## My portfolio website

This is just a small website for me to showcase my projects and experiences.

It's pretty much static right now with a couple of components

### Stack:
* Nextjs for Front End
* Dockerized and hosted on an ECR container
* Used AWS ECS to create an autoscaling group with a single T2.Small EC2 instance for compute
* Squarespace is the domain provider but Amazon Credential Manager certifies for HTTPS

I might move some of my other projects into the same front end stack as different pages but that'd tbd
